The story of Aiden Hoover, a time traveller from 1843, goes back in time to the year 637. He makes a good friend Karla, with whom he later falls in love. His good friends were Leo, Isabella, Keith Voland and many more.

**Part 1:**
He goes to Galacia, for some work. Karla dies from a tragedy unknown, on an island right next to Mistae. The "unknowns" were called the "dark souls" who came out at night. Isabella's nation was quite to close to Mistae too. Hence, she knew about the beasts. They rushed out, and end up on Mistae. While, Karla's body was burnt up by the moonlight. I, Isabella and Leo were rescued by some people who reminded me of Vikings. 

On my way i recalled my memories with Karla. I met her when i was 14 years old. I had lost my parents, they were murdered. I wanted revenge, and i wanted to kill them. I followed them. They had a family. I killed the children, and the mother. The killers were left, as it seemed. I sneaked up behind the door. Knocked and killed the first. The second was depressed that it was easy to kill him, though i had a second thought for a second. A little girl came up to the door and thanked me for killing her family. She wanted to die too. I didn't kill her, I liked her looks, and she looked innocent. I was crying, realised i did what the killers did. Their neighbours were close, i took the girl and fled. She was Karla Hiott. She was about to die from her parents anyways, she didn't tell me why.

From then she has been saving my life since. I began to develop feelings for her. She was a gorgeous girl. I was about to date her, but got some work to visit Galacia, there she died. 

They were the Volands. They were truly nice to us, and the hospitality they showed was top notch. I met their children, all were nice. I liked Scarlett Voland, an ambitious girl. She wanted to know about her family's secrets. I helped her in finding the books of 'The Truth', since i was a part time detective. Keith was close to his father, and knew more than others, plus he was the eldest. He helped us too. I knew it was risky, so i told Keith to lie, else he would die. Scarlett didn't listen to me, and was caught red handed by Edgar.

Scarlett was executed by the similar technique of Blood Eagle torture from which Karla died. Before someone died, they are injected with an unknown serum to have the worst death possible, which makes them a 'dead soul'. Someone becomes a 'dark soul' when they are very angry, and want to take revenge. They become a different person, and attain the dark soul. I was injected with the same serum, while others were sleeping and Scarlett was dead already. Keith wasnt found suspicious. I felt a surge of power through me.  I was hung upside-down in an empty bucket, with a tap on. The water dripped on my forehead, and dropped into the bucket. The bucket was soon halfway filled, and my long hairs floated in it. By the morning the water was in my nose, and i was bary breathing with my mouth. No one was in the room, and Leo comes to look for me. He had some speciality of sensing people's aura. I was freed and ran, as my brain lost all the humanity. Leo was caught, dead. I woke Isabella up, took the horses and fled. I felt so I'll, so Isabella took over.
