...looking behind at her burning body, I teared up. Saw some faint magenta aura around her. And with a sharp ring, I could no more hear anything around me. Saw the wolves howling, and the people crying, but soundless. Or was it my ears? "Darling, I love you, and will forever. Let's meet someday again."

Neither did Leo, nor Isabella hear that. With a desperation of retracting back my own steps, far from the start, my body involuntarily stiffened against my will. All I could was move ahead. I wanted those days back. I lost them, forever. Didn't look back after then. Never looked back. Never, ever.

Karla was a kind angel with a pleasant smile. A beauty everyone would fall for. So intelligent and caring. And the past, murkier than a puddle. He too, really exists. Anyways, she was such ace in archery, graceful shots by her arrows, right in there, heart of mine. Plus, she was possessed the intelligence and power of a ruler. She told me once — she wanted to join the King's army one day.

It was at this moment that her precious memories flashed before my eyes.

Those memories coincide with the death of my family. I was young back then. I was on my way back home after gathering wood. It was a gloomy evening, with snowy dark clouds above. I saw some traces of somebody's foot, marked with something red. I assumed my parents invited someone for my sister's birthday, who has brought "redchie" tree sap. Deep in the heart, it just felt wrong, to bring someone a bottle of redchie tree sap on a birthday. I swiftly moved through the thick snow to my house.

And, the hell I was presented with... I just... couldn't believe it. Blood splashes, stew and chips of redchie wood everywhere. My family was assassinated. My mother's head was in the special stew. Rest of the body, split into two. Father's face so badly damaged, it was hard to recognise him. Little sister was charred under the chimney. Some men with axes and heated heads crushed precious lives. What else could be worse, I wanted to die, suicide. In one corner, I saw a girl, shivering. Blood splashes on her face showed the instincts of a wolf. But I knew a girl my age couldn't murder a whole family, although she possessed a blooded axe. I was too young to think the otherwise.

I, scared of her, asked her her name. She, scared of me, did not respond. I ran off, with her (for I couldn't let a little girl die in the cold), to the nearest village. Seeing two poor kids, a family adopted us. We lived like a family, was she my un-related sister now? No. Her name was Karla Hiott.

Years went on in struggle. We still were uneasy with each other. But one day, a bad fight broke out in the house. Their madness soon rendered upon us, stating us as pests. We were used to hearing that. But not anymore. I lost control, not as often as I ever did. I clutched the bloody axe that was used against my family, and now it's my time to use it against my so-called adopted family. With swift movements and no sounds, I chopped them up. 

I couldn't believe what I did. The scene resembled the one I saw years ago. Karla's face flushed with blood, once again as she held the axe I used. The beast inside of me, born out of death of my family, unleashed for the first time. I must control it.

We ran, once again, off to the woods. We built a treehouse and spent another few peaceful years there. We mastered skills, and helped each other. She, in her early adulthood, looked like a prism through rainbow. A shining master art of beauty. I didn't know her past, I didn't know what she didn't behind my back. I only knew, that I have falled for her, the potential but unlikely murdered of my family. I don't care about it, love conquers it all. My first, and only love: Karla Hiott.
