In the dark Woods of Galacia, Mistae lived the Volands. Mr. Voland was a lumberjack, and Mrs. Voland, an exceptional cook and hunter. They lived in a pretty average house with their kids — Keith Voland, Historia Voland and Edgar Voland. The family was quite simple, everyone was kind and warm-hearted, or as it all seemed.

Nobody knew what lies behind them, who knew where they came from, they were not natives though. They seemed nice, and yes they were almost all the time, but deep inside their blood lies a ferocious beast. Their origins and still hidden deep in the mist, far from our reach.

We knew nothing about them until some confidential data breached last year. It was found that the Volands had a fourth child — Scarlett Voland. The children of Volands do not get to know the secrets of Volands until they are adults. But Scarlett's parents found her reading the 'Book of History', a major book of the volume — 'The Truth', written by the first ruler of the continent, thousands of years back. Scarlett's body was annihilated and her brain and heart were fed to the sons.

Around eight months ago, I got to visit Mistae's dark Woods of Galacia for some work. I did not know much about the Volands then. I did not know about the country of Mistae either. I was on board with Leo, Isabella, and my best friend, Karla. We were naïve in front of Isabella, who was from lands far away about which we barely knew anything. Leo was a good friend of mine, who was goofy but intelligent. And my best friend Karla was fine at everything. We were childhood friends. She has saved my life a million times. She was nice, and also ludicrous.

It was midnight when Leo discovered a great storm incoming. We soared through the seas as fast as we could and ended up on a small island. On our way, a bunch of supplies sank into the water. We enjoyed what we had. It was about the time to sleep. I admired the violet sky, dotted with many small dots, and a big yellow small dot. It was late at night, the island was brightened up by the moonlight, but still dark; and a strange coldness breezed through, giving me chills. Anyhow, we slept for some rest, which we never had in our homeland.

I slept well and sound, until I heard some creaking noises. I felt a cold warmth around me. I got up, and the scene I was presented with was what I could never forget in an eternity. My mind could not interpret what it was — dream or reality?

Karla was sleeping and snoring, looked like she was enjoying her sleep. But, her limbs were cut off. Her skull was pried open and her brain was exposed to the cold darkness. Her spine was crooked and produced sounds. And the worst part, her ribs were broad open, and her heart could be seen pumping rapidly. Plus, her blood was over, lit on fire. I could not see it. It was a punch right in my stomach. I still wonder, what, how, and why? Why her? Why?.

As a measure to wake others up, I shouted softly. Leo was immobilized by sleep paralysis. What could be worse! And I saw Isabella's face — stoked and sad, but her facial expression made me think something was wrong with her, maybe she knew something. She said to rush out immediately, I carried Leo on my back and ran alongside Isabella, soaked in tears.
